When upgrading your mudlib always make a backup of your stuff:

	1. shutdown the mud
	2. cd gurablib then run: ./scripts/backup_lib
	3. run "git log" to see what version of files your currently using
	4. update your repository with: git pull
	5. review your file lib/kernel/include/local_config.h against
		lib/kernel/include/local_config.h.default
	6. look at the git log to see if there are any incompatabilities
		listed in the notes.
	7. Restart the mud.
	8. If you have problems check the logs to see whats going wrong.
	9. If you can't figure things out drop me an email:
		mein@cs.umn.edu

If you need to revert things:
	1. stop your mud if its semi running.
	2. verify you have a valid backup in the backups directory
	3. mv lib lib.foo
	4. tar xvfz backups/(timestamp)_mudlib.tgz 
		where (timestamp)_mudlib.tgz is the backup you want to restore.
	5. start your mud.
