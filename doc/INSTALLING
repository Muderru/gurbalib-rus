SETTING THINGS UP:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
cd to your gurbalib dir and perform the following actions:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.  If you do not have perl on your system you can
                just read the script and figure out what directorys to create.
	cd src

	Download the latest version of dgd from github: 
		git clone https://github.com/dworkin/dgd.git
		cd dgd
		git submodule init
		git submodule update
		cd src
		make
		make install
			** Note: you will get 1 error on this when it tries to
				mv ../bin/dgd ../bin/dgd.old

	cd ../../..
	cp src/dgd/bin/dgd ./bin/
        cp mud.dgd.examp mud.dgd
	edit mud.dgd
		change the directory entry to where you installed things.
		Look it over and change other things if you want.
	cd lib/kernel/include
	cp local_config.h.default local_config.h
	edit local_config.h file and change at least the first 3 entries
	cd ../../..

	You may want to edit the files in lib/data/messages/

	cp scripts/startmud bin/startmud
	edit bin/startmud and set ROOT
	./bin/startmud

	If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the mud.dgd config file.
		(4000 by default)

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.  If you goof up and mess up the first
login, you will need to clean the mud with scripts/clean_mud and then
start over again, to get an admin account.

XXX Warning, right now there is a bug in the system, you will need to
logout and back in before admin privilages work for the first player.

OTHER THINGS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Downloading additional documentation.
	I recommend grabbing the LPC-doc documentation which is
	basically dgd extended documentation.  You can grab it by doing
	the following:
	cd lib/doc
	git clone https://github.com/dworkin/lpc-doc dgd
	ln -s dgd/kfun kfun
	cd ../..

	You can also run the following script to download yet more docs:
	./scripts/download_lpc_docs


Gurbalib ships with an ftp server which is enabled by default,
	on whatever port you select + 1  if you telnet to 4000
	you ftp to 4001.  If you want to disable it, add the following line
	to lib/std/include/local_config.h:
	#define DISABLE_FTP 1

If you want a squeaky clean mud you can also remove the files in
	lib/domains/ except for required (I would keep them around for
	a little while though since they are semi good example code)

You will want to read the docs that are available, in lib/doc.  There is
	a ton of stuff to go through.  I would start with the following:
	lib/doc/intro		# Over view of docs and commands to read them
	lib/doc/misc/admin	# Introduction to Administration
	lib/doc/help/wiz/bootcamp 	# Introduction to wizardhood
	also check out the todo list: 
	lib/TODO
