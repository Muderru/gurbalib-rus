Introduction to GurbaLib development

The man command is similar to the help command for players,
however you can get additional documentation not available to them.
Here are some of the things you can read about:

help   : Documentation available to players through the help command
afun   : Documentation on functions defined in /kernel/lib/afun
safun  : Documentation on functions defined in /sys/afun
kfun   : Documentation on functions provided by the driver
kernel : General documentation of the kernel
misc   : misc documentation
modules: Documentation on specific modules

When something exists as an safun, afun or kfun, the higher function will be
used.  kfun will be used last, then afun, then safun.
When something exists both as an afun and a kfun, you can review
the kfun version by using 'man kfun/subject'
