SYNOPSIS

       void do_menu( mixed header, mixed **menu, varargs mixed footer )
       mixed *make_fcall( object ob, string fun, args... )

DESCRIPTION
       The menu module can be used to produce nice looking menus and
       handle selecting items from a menu.

       A menu consists of an array of arrays, and looks as follows:

       ({    /* start of menu */
         ({  /* start of item */
           string key, mixed desc, mixed opt, mixed *action
         })
       })

       Key is what the user has to type to select this item.

       Desc is a descriptive text presented to the user as part
       of the menu. It can be provided as a string, or as an fcall
       array (see below)

       Opt is an optional extra text that is displayed to the user,
       it can be a string or fcall array

       Action is what gets done when the user selected the item, it
       is an fcall array.

       Fcall arrays are made with help of the make_fcall() function.
       make_fcall() expects at least 2 arguments, an object and a function
       name. Optionally you can provide more arguments.

       An fcall array defines the object and function that will be called
       for getting text or performing an action. Any extra arguments provided
       to make_fcall() will be used as arguments to the to be called function.

       Please note that the internal format of the fcall array may change 
       in the future, it might even change into something other then an array,
       so always use make_fcall().
ERRORS
       This module will throw an error when called with improper arguments.
