Properties are a generic way for storing information on an
object such that that information can easily be accessed by
other objects without a need for 'set/get' methods.

Gurbalib's property system implements optional access checks
on properties which can be set with the set_property() method.

The property system uses require_priv() for this, so using
anything other then * for read access is bound to be quite
expensive when used a lot. Restricting write access can be
quite useful. It is possible to create 'read-only' properties
by setting wpriv to '-' (without the quotes).

In order to make it possible to preserve read/write access
information, setting a property to nil is not the same as
removing the property.

You can use properties by inheriting the module found at:
/sys/lib/modules/m_properties.c
