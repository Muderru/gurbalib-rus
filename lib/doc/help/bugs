If you encounter a bug, please do not abuse it to your advantage (if
that is possible.) Bugs are something that shouldn't exist. If you
come across a bug, there is a command you can use to report the
circumstances of the bug. It is called 'bug', appropriately
enough. You can be sure that when you submit a bug report it's taken
seriously. If it's a serious or potentially nasty bug, a small reward
coming in your direction might not be out of the way :). Also, if you
have a history of reporting bugs, we'll like you more than the other
non-reporters. :)
