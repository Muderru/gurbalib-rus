Gurbalib Code Style Guide

Good coding pratices commonly mention that it is a good idea to have a
style guide for shared projects like a mudlib, so here is ours.  Mostly
it's done via example.  Feel free to add to it, or give us suggestions.

Code blocks are indented 3 spaces:
	if (foo) {
	   do_something();
	}

There is one blank line between function definitions.

There are blanks after keywords, commas, and other structures:
	Correct:
		if (int x, int y) {
	Wrong:
		if(int x,int y){

Optional braces are not optional, do them:
	if (1) do_stuff();  /* This is wrong */
should be:
	if (1) {             /* The right way */
	   do_stuff();
	}

Optional ()'s are also required, see the example in the next if statement
	for an example of how to do them correctly.

Lines are limited to 80 chars, try to break it at something logical before the
	limit, and indent 3 spaces after the fact:
if ((this_object()->query_name() == "sirdude")) &&
   (this_object()->query_environment() == obj)) {

   do_stuff();
}

Do not use comments that just fill up whitespace, or just restate the code:
	/*
	*
	* bingo
	*
	*/
	int bingo(void) {
	   return 1;
	}
Should be something similar or remove the comment completely:
	/* This function is called when you win the game */
	int bingo(void) {
	   return 1;
	}

There is an auxlillary function gurbalib/scripts/indent_it that uses
	gnu indent to do a pretty good job of formating things.  It does
	mess up mappings and arrays though so you'll want to check them.

The best way to get a feel for the rules is to look at the example code
	(the current mudlib)  If you see any conflicts please let us know.
