DESCRIPTION
	The english_to_racial() function will translate a word from english
	to another language. A random word will be created / picked to be the
	foreign language. The word is then added to the global database for
	that language. The arguments are both strings, the first being the
	name of the language to convert to (dwarf, catfolk, human, etc), the
	second is the word to translate. The translated word is then returned.
	If the word already exists in the language database then no new word
	will be generated, the old one will be returned instead.
