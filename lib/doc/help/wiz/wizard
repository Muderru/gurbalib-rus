You're a wizard now.
That means you have a ton of additional commands available to you now
and you can start creating areas on the mud.  Use the 'cmds' command
to see what extra stuff you can do and use the -h argument to get detailed
info on various commands.  Example: ls -h

Some basic wizard commands you should get familiar with:
	cd, ls, cat, more, edit, clone, update, goto

You should start exploring the documentation
in /doc, as well as look at lots of sample code in /domains

When your having problems don't forget to look at the logs:
cd /logs or cd /logs/errors and poke around....

If you haven't yet type: help bootcamp
bootcamp is a very brief introduction to get you started as a new wizard.

You can also read up on the following additional wizard help files, which
are located in /doc/wiz/help:
area           coding         monster_code   room_code      wizard
bootcamp       language_d     object_code    style
