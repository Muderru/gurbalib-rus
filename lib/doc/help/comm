There are various commands on the mud to help you communicate
with other players: Say, tell, whisper, emote to name just a few....

Try them out, most of them work in the following way:
Say hi!          (will tell everyone in the current room hi)
tell sirdude hi  (will tell the player sirdude hi)
To see the basics of how to use a command use the -h option.
example: say -h

for more in depth information try: help say or help say-modifiers
