Welcome to our lpmud.  I'm sure you'll want to get started so just a couple
of basics to get you going.

First off use the cmds command to see what types of things you can do.
Each command has a -h flag for help.  Example try: score -h

There are commands for talking to other players: say, tell, whisper
Some of them only work on people that are in the same room as you.

There are commands that are used to interact with things: look, go (direction),
open, get,
Lots of commands have simple aliases as well, examples:
	n (go north), s (go south), l (look)

There are commands for combat: attack, hp, score, wear, wield

Start by going north, look around, read signs and have fun....

when you get tired type quit to exit the game, rest up and come back and
visit us again soon.

Read the other help topics for more in depth information.
