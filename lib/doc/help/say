	Use this command to say something to the room you are currently
standing in. Everybody in the room will be able to see what you are saying.
If you want to talk only to a specific person, use tell or whisper instead.
	The say command has been globally aliased to "'" (without the quotes).
So, instead of typing:

> say Hello

you can type

> 'Hello

to achieve the same effect.
	There are various ways of affecting the way your character says
something. By adding certain characters to the end of what you say you can say
it in different ways. For example, typing

> 'Hello

will result in 'You say: Hello.' being written on the screen. However, if you
say "Hello!" instead of "Hello" (With the exclamation mark) you will see 'You
exclaim: Hello!'. If you add yet another exclamation point you will yell your
message, and a third one will make you shout it.
	Similarly, if you put a question mark at the end of your statement,
you will ask instead of say. Simple enough so far.
	But if you want even more control of the way your character says
something, there are even more characters that can be appended. If you type

> 'I rule!#

(Note the "#" at the end) then it will be seen as 'You boast: I rule!'. Or, if
you want to be thoughtful when you speak, add a "%" to it. That will result in
'You say thoughtfully: I'm a big thinker!'
	These are only two of the many modifiers to your speech. A complete list
can be found in 'help say-modifiers'. Use them frequently, they really spice up
a conversation.
