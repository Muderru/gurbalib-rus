NAME
	sqlite3_exec - sqlite3 extension: exec statement

SYNOPSIS
	int *sqlite3_exec(string filename, string sql)

DESCRIPTION
	This command is only available if you have the SQLITE3 extension
	available.  Filename is the location of your sqlite database
	and sql is the statement you want to run.

	You can find the extension on github here:
	https://github.com/november-kilo/dgd-lpc-ext

RETURN VALUE
	If extension is not enabled, or filename is unreadable this
	command will return nil.  Otherwise it will return the value
	returned from the external call to sqlite3_exec. It is an
	array of type int; the first element is the return status
	value (found in /usr/include/sqlite.h) and the second
	element is the number of changes the query made.

EXAMPLES
	int *x;
	string st;

	st = "drop table users";

	x = sqlite3_exec("/tmp/mydatabase.sql", st);
	if (x[0] == 0) {
	   write("Success. " + x[1] + " change(s) were made.\n");
	} else {
	   write("Error in statement: " + st + "\n";
	}
