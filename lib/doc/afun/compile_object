NAME
	compile_object - compiles an object

SYNOPSIS
	object compile_object(string filepath, string code ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Compiles object at filepath.  If object is already compiled, it will
	be upgraded if a newer version exists at filepath.  If filepath is
	not a legal object an error will result.  A filepath must contain a
	legal subdirectory for an object to be compiled.  File paths are
	legal if they contain one of the following subdirectories:
		/obj/, /mon/, /objects/, /monsters/, /daemons/, /rooms/,
		/cmds/

	If code is supplied, compile the object from code instead of reading
	it from a file.

	For more info on objects see /doc/misc/objects.

RETURN VALUE
	Returns the compiled object.  If there is an error, report the
	error as a runtime error and  return nil.

EXAMPLES
	string filename;
	object obj;

	obj = find_object(filename);
	if (!obj) {
	   obj = compile_object(filename);
	   obj->setup();
	}
