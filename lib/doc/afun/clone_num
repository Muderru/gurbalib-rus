NAME
	clone_num - returns an objects clone number

SYNOPSIS
	int clone_num(varargs object obj)

DESCRIPTION
	If obj is given, return clone number for that object.
	If no obj argument, return clone number for this_object().

RETURN VALUE
	An int corresponding to an objects clone number.  Clone numbers
	exist for all cloned objects, and each objects clone number is
	unique to that clone.  If a clone does not exist return -1.

EXAMPLES
	XXX Some code checks ! clone_num  some code checks == 0 and checks -1
	I think we need to redo some of it and find out what the code should
	be.
