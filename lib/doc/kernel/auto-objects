Gurbalib has 2 auto objects

Primary auto object: /kernel/lib/auto.c
  Contains afuns that are in every object, deals with security, clone tracking, 
     automagic maintenance of linked lists, call_outs and communications with 
     various kernel subsystems.

Simulated auto object: /sys/lib/auto.c, /sys/lib/safun.c, /sys/lib/safun/*
  /sys/lib/auto.c is a special object for implementing the safun functionality.  
     When compiled, the source for it will be assembled from the .c files in
     /sys/safun/.  If a function in safun needs a global variable or a
     function prototype, put it inside of /sys/lib/safun.c
