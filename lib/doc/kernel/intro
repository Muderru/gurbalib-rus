Gurbalib uses a custom written kernel.

It was started by Fudge in times now lost to history.  Since then, it has
been updated and enhanced by the Gurbalib resurrection project.

The error handling and dynamic/in-place recompilation support was ported
from Way of the Force.

The security system was built from scratch for Gurbalib, but is inspired
by the MudOS stack based security system as used by many mudos native libs.

The multi-level auto object support and auto assembling of the
'simulated afun' object was built from scratch for Gurbalib.

Many ideas for this kernel come from Dworkin's kernel library, the
Way of the Force kernel and discussions on the DGD mailing list.
