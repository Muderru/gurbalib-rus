The compiler daemon takes care of tracking inheritance and generating
graphs used for rebuilding objects depending on an inheritable.

Much of the actual work for a full rebuild is done by the warmboot command.
For simple rebuilds, this is contained in the rebuild command.

The reason for putting this into the commands instead of the compiler daemon
 is to allow the warmboot command to recompile itself before anything else,
and allow changes to the rebuild process to become active before the
actual rebuild.

The algorithm for generating the list of dependent objects was developed at
Way of the Force by Aidil and Kalten.
