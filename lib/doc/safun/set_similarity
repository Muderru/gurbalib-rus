NAME
	set_similarity - quantify the similarity of two sets

SYNOPSIS
	nomask static float set_similarity(mixed *a1, mixed *a2)

DESCRIPTION
	Calculate the jaccard similarity between 2 sets.
	If the sets are similar it will be close to 1 and if they
	are not similar it will be closer to 0.

RETURN VALUE
	Returns a value in the range 0 (not similar at all) to 1 (very similar).

EXAMPLES
	int *a, *b;
	float res;

	a = ({5|1, 2, 3, 4, 5,});
	b = ({5|4, 5, 6, 7, 8,});

	res = set_similarity(a,b);
	write("Set Similarity = " + res + "\n";
