NAME
	strstr - finds location of a substring in a string

SYNOPSIS
	int strstr(string str, sting what)

DESCRIPTION
	Checks str for a match to what.  The index for the first character
	of the first match is returned, or else -1 is returned when no
	match is found.

	strstr is expensive, in most cases you can use sscanf instead.

RETURN VALUE
	Index where what was found in str, or else -1.

EXAMPLES
	int x;
	string stuff;

	stuff = "Hello, my name is frank.";
	x = strstr(stuff, "frank");
	write("X = " + x + "\n");   /* x = 17 */
	x = strstr(stuff, "george");
	write("X = " + x + "\n");   /* x = -1 */
