How it works

  Clone tracking uses a doubly linked list that is
  maintained by the _F_create() and _F_destruct() functions
  in the auto object.

  The head of the list is the master of an object, following
  the next_clone() link lets you iterate over the list of clones

Example:

int do_to_all_clones(object ob) {
  /*
   * Get the master for the object
   */
  ob = find_object( ob->base_name() );

  /*
   * This loops through all clones, but
   * skips the master.
   */
  while ( ob = ob->next_clone() ) {
    ob->do_something();
  }
}
