Gurbalib was started in the second half of the 90s by
Fudge as a way to learn about lpc and mudlib coding.

Much of the original code of Gurbalib up to and including
version 0.40 was done by Fudge, with a few bits of code
by Jason Cone (intermud daemon and conversion daemon) and
Greg Lewis (mudmode implementation)

After 1999 public development mostly stopped, and version
0.40 was the last official public release by Fudge.

From then to 2009, a number of private derivates existed,
one of which was used to start the Gurbalib resurrection
project, this was a derivate by Nullinfinite (Chris). It 
was first reduced to a 'pure' port of Gurbalib to dgd 1.2
with type checking 2. Most of this was done by Nullinfinite.

During this time, Cerihan and me (Aidil) were playing with
our own private derivate, which was based on the version
from Nullinfinite. Once he was done with stripping down his
version to a 'pure' port to dgd 1.2, the projects were merged
and the Gurbalib resurrection project made its first public
release.

As of this writing, there have been over 310 new revisions,
much of the kernel has been reimplemented and extended, and
the lib had many bug fixes and a number of small extensions.

Many more people got involved, and Gurbalib now contains code
from a large number of people. Currently there are 4 people
with commit rights to the public repository:

Aidil
Cerihan
Nullinfinite
Quixadhal

Much of the original design is still in place, and people
familiar with Lima should easily recognize its influence on
Gurbalib's design still.
