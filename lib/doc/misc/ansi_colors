Ansi Colors
 
Ansi color codes will color text sent to a player who has an ansi compliant
client.  Color codes are embedded within the text sent to a player; the players
clients hide the codes and perform the coloring of text in response to the
codes.  Color codes must be terminated with a reset color code, or subsequent
text sent to player will remain colored.

With Gurba, color codes are not used when defining colors to be sent to a
player.  Instead, Pinkfish codes are used.  These are translated into ansi color
codes immediately before being sent to a player.  Pinkfish codes are denoted by
pairs of '%^' surrounding a legal color code.
An example of the Pinkfish markup code:

write("%^RED%^red%^GREEN%^green%^RESET%^");

The example would be seen by player as just redgreen, in 2 colors.

A list of legal color codes:
  reset: 'RESET'
  colors:  'BLACK', 'RED', 'GREEN', 'ORANGE', 'YELLOW', 'BLUE', 'MAGENTA',
    'CYAN', 'WHITE'
  bold colors:  'B_BLACK', 'B_RED', 'B_GREEN', 'B_ORANGE', 'B_YELLOW', 'B_BLUE',
    'B_MAGENTA', 'B_CYAN', 'B_WHITE'
  attributes:  'BOLD', 'ITALIC', 'UNDERLINE', 'FLASH', 'REVERSE'

Pinkfish codes make it easy to insert colored text into communications.  Gurba
allows this by default, and players are able to embed Pinkfish codes into their
says, tells, etc.
