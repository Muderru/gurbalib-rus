XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for higher level concepts 
and ideas that don't translate well to a given file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

m_lockable, keys
m_switchable, Levers
auto dest/update of all instances of an object

Old stuff from ../doc/TODO:
- Add linked list support to auto object
- Mask destruct_object() to deregister objects and clones
- Ensure a create function in the auto object gets called
  to register new objects/clones
- Rewrite fake objects module to use LWOs
- Add TLS support to the driver object
- Rewrite object_d to track inheritance
- Change update to deal with inheritables
- Change update to allow updating all depending objects

Fix it so deep inventory works with autoload.

Fix bunny so that it doesn't attack you second time you pick flower...
In combat the bunny does't always attack...

Fix rooms not loading objects so it loads the singularity(sing.c)

Fix up Events like body_enter body_leave  good way to do 
gurba monsters that talk when things happen I think...
Harry...

Need to convert Monster item_command stuff to object_commands

chan, and mudlist shouldn't return cached stuff if not connected?

locate username   (for finding people on other muds, i3locate in dead souls)
mail "user@mud" support...

write a showtree command that shows an objects inherit list?

locate command gives:
Intermud error 'unk-type' received from Ulario
Unhandled packet type: locate-req

rebuild - doesn't give an error...

rwho sirdude gives a very cryptic error message.

after possess rat
	$>  cmds
	$Runtime error: Value is not an int
	$>  ls
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)
	$>  cd
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)

Move more of std/obj/player.c:receive_message() to m_cmds.c:do_game_command()

Modify combat so you can have multiple damage messages for a given weapon???
	like the swiss army knife in eotl...

Fix it so list works when objects don't compile.

When you first login on mud creation, you must logout 
	before getting "admin rights"

Look into MPX support, MCCP or KaVir's MUD Protocol Handler
	http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2811

do_game_command should look at full command path, right now it doesn't...
	This is a perms issue at this point.

Fix it so you can do the following:
	possess rat
	call -h

add a rest/stand command where you gain hp otherwise you don't...
Add fullness/intoxication to score output...

 a built in history command, for the last 20 commands
#! preforms the last executed command
#$ preforms the last word of the last executed command.
#(num) preforms that command from the history
#(string) preforms the last history command starting with (string)

a bot spams random hints to the info channel every so often.

defend command allows you to proctect another player.
Things attacking it will attack you instead.

Fix check and checkmud functions so that they continue on errors.
Also fix it so we avoid the too many objects error...

Convert DEBUG define's to LOG_D->log's & levels...

update doc checker to look at -h for commands  (see also and other things)

Fix channels so that there is no conflict  between wiz command and wiz channel.
also make sure you can't create an empty channel.
	Maybe make it chan cmd wiz (channel)
	(all commands need to be prefixed with 'cmd')
