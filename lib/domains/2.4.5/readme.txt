The code in the domains/2.4.5 sub directory, is a derived work from the:
   2.4.5 LPmud, it is copyright by Lars Pensj|, 1990.

Source code herein refers to the source code, and any executables
created from the same source code.

All rights reserved.  Permission is granted to extend and modify the
source code provided subject to the restriction that the source code may
not be used in any way whatsoever for monetary gain.

This readme.txt covers everything in /domains/2.4.5

If you do not agree with the above statements you should remove everything
from this sub directory and not use it, your mud will work fine with out it.

This is a work in progress, it tries to maintain the essence of the 2.4.5
mud, however it tries to implement it in our own mudlib on a dgd driver,
as clear, clean example code of what a mudlib area should look like.

It also extends the code in some ways where it looked like it would be a
good idea to provide more context, or information to the user.

This is a work in progress and is currently not finished.
